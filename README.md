### Kassett Actions

#### Description
Kassett Actions is suite of tools used for building CI/CD pipelines. 
It is composed of a Python library and various github actions that implement
various parts of the API.

#### Deploy
Publishing Github Actions on the Github Actions marketplace unfortunately 
allows only one action.yml file per repository. This repository 
deploys / creates actions in other repositories. Each subdirectory in the 
actions repository must have an action.yml file and a README.md file.
